2. Ticket Assignment


Support agent John Doe logs in.

# Communication


Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.

He makes sure to leave a proper message:

3. Working the issue

System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:


<img width="801" alt="Screen Shot 2024-12-31 at 7 56 41 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c3f2717-ca57-4193-ac90-da82a4acf389" />


Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.

She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:

4. Resolution

Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>

This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.

There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.

I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
